EXTRACT The power of Malema’s rhetoric and populism is huge. He exhorts, he cajoles, he makes up enemies (Indians and journalists), and he picks issues to exploit – all this fires up his supporters.

Look at how he has turned the land restitution debate and the resultant parliamentary hearings into a referendum on the new SA and a debate on section 25 (the property clause) of the constitution even when that is not at all the issue here. Whenever Malema shouts the ANC gets the shakes and adopts his policies. As he gains confidence, the ANC loses its resoluteness.
