EXTRACT Selling upmarket properties has been a challenge for estate agents since December, said Cape Town-based property expert Toni Enderli. He said the land issue has negatively affected the property business over the past few months. Enderli said the debate around land redistribution has left a lot of investors worried and hesitant, leading to a decline in the sale of properties in the top-end market of properties above R5-million. However, he said there is not much change in the first-time-buyer market of properties under R1.5m. Enderli felt the land issue had not been approached well, and a lot of comments loosely uttered have scared off potential investors.
