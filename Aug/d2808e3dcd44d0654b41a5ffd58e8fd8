EXTRACT Over the week the rand retreated to levels last seen in the horrific Zuma days. On Friday it breached the key R15-to-the-dollar level.

The consequences of such a horrendously weak rand will be horrific for the poor. One analyst pointed out that the currency’s vertiginous depreciation over the past week may mean a 20c increase in the petrol price. That means virtually everything the poor consume – from transport to food – will increase in price. This on the back of massive fuel price hikes in recent months.
