EXTRACT Ramaphosa's supporters are wondering what's become of their man. They're confused and bewildered. "What's happened to Cyril?" has become the constant refrain. People who were full of hope when he took over are beginning to despair. An impression is fast gaining ground that Ramaphosa is not only a weak leader but a coward. He buckles easily under pressure.
