EXTRACT The New Yorker’s John Cassidy describes Trump’s response to questions from reporters at a UN press conference as “an alarming display of insensitivity, narcissism, and misogyny.” While members of his own party believe the allegations made by the women should be taken very seriously, Trump has refused to let the FBI look into the allegations against Kavanaugh, saying The Democrats know “it’s a big, fat con job. And they go into a room, and I guarantee you, they laugh like hell on what they pulled off on you and on the public. They laugh like hell.

I can only say what they have done to this man is incredible.” A subscription helps you enjoy the best of our business content every day along with benefits such as exclusive Financial Times articles, Morningstar financial data, and digital access to the Sunday Times and Times Select.
