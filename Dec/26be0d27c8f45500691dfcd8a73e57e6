Extract Why is Tom Moyane so desperate to get his job back? The former SA Revenue Service (Sars) boss is exploring further legal avenues to challenge his dismissal and argue that President Cyril Ramaphosa and judge Robert Nugent treated him unfairly.

You would think that Moyane would now limp off with his tail between his legs, particularly after the Nugent inquiry exposed him as a wrecking ball at Sars and a minion of criminal networks, including the illicit tobacco industry and the Guptas. But Moyane is determined to fight on, even though there is little prospect of success.
