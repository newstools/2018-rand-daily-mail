EXTRACT South Africa's experience of the transition from apartheid following the Codesa negotiations and the KwaZulu-Natal peace talks was commended globally, and other conflict zones tried to use our model and know-how to resolve their problems.

When Thabo Mbeki took over, he led the initiative for development in Africa and campaigned for greater involvement of the continent's leaders in multilateral forums.
