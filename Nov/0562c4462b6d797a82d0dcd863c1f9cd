It’s all beginning to make sense. With Jacob Zuma finally off centre stage, it’s been surprising that his followers still have the nerve to cock a snook at the new establishment. That they don’t seem to have lost their swagger. It’s now evident they have found a new hero in Julius Malema.  He has not only picked up the baton, but is deploying the propaganda tools left by Bell Pottinger even better than Zuma did — white monopoly capital, radical economic transformation and so on, with racist insults thrown in for good measure.  He’s now the leader of the looting brigands; defender of the miscreants who’ve laid waste to this country and made it the laughing stock of the world.
