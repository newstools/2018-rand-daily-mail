EXTRACT Julsing-Strydom, who has spoken at events with Noakes, said she had always been polite to him, but felt her name had been dragged through the mud. “I don’t get a cent from the food industry.” She said her husband told her to ignore the insults, which she does, but it was upsetting. She has tried to respond with scientific articles on nutrition and had offered to discuss nutrition science on the phone with any of her critics, but she said no one had ever taken her up on her offer. Noakes told Times Select he stood by his belief that Julsing-Strydom had colluded. “It’s on the record. We have the e-mails. We describe it in the book. What she did was completely and utterly unforgivable. What happened thereafter is the result purely of her own actions. She needs to front up and accept responsibility.  Until she does that, she sets herself up as a target.” We have several subscription options to help you enjoy the best of our content every day, including exclusive Financial Times articles, Morningstar financial data and full digital access to The Wall Street Journal.
