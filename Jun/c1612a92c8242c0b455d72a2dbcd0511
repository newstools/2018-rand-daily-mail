EXTRACT For a moment we united behind a bunch of young people representing our nation, forgetting that it was just a few days before that Floyd Shivambu, a leader of the EFF and member of parliament, had insulted the minister of Finance, the director-general of the National Treasury and other officials by saying that they were cowed by, specifically, a South African of Indian origin.
