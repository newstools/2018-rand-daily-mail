EXTRACT Trump arrived late for the G-7 meet and left early. He changed his mind on a whim, withdrawing his support for an agreed to G-7 Communique – on Twitter! He insulted his predecessors (particularly President Barak Obama) blaming them for selling out America with “ridiculous” tariff deals… It was bonkers. You know things are questionable when a crazy dictator who will not hesitate to have a soldier executed for being out of step at a military parade seems sane and reasonable when compared to the leader of the Free World. It feels like we’re living through a dystopian nightmare… either that or we’ve been invaded by aliens trying to colonise our world by driving us crazy first.
